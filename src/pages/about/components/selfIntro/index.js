                    <p>Hey, I'm Shenqi Ye. You can call me Barry! Compared to professional stuff, I wanna introduce myself start with things I love which can define me better. Know first that Iâ€™m obsessed with art and books. I love swimming, drawing, and drama, and thrilling roller coasters and coffee make me happy. </p>
                    <p>Ok, now some education stuff. At present, I'm a graduate student at the University of Southern California(USC) and my major is Computer Science in Game Development. I really enjoy visual things so I have great interests in games, animation, interactive applications, graphics, digital media and these kinds of things. I finished my bachelor's degree in Digital Media Technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University, China.</p>
                    <p>Because of the Covid-19, I took one year's online courses in China last year. At the same time, I had a full-time job as a front-end developer in Meituan, Beijing. I was mainly responsible for the development of the WeChat mini program for a community group-buy department. It was a brand new experience for me and taught me plenty of skills that cannot be learned from school.</p>
                    <p>I'd like to become not only a programmer but a designer in the future, a designer in media and entertainment. A line of code, more interesting the world. That is the coolest thing I want to do!</p>
